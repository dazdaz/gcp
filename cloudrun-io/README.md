## Instructions to Deploy This Script as a Cloud Run Job

To deploy the above bash script (let's name it latency-measure.sh) in a Google Cloud Run job, you'll create a container image that runs the script as its entrypoint. The job will execute the script once per run, and you can view the output in Cloud Logging. Note: This assumes you have a Google Cloud project set up, and the script requires mounting a GCS bucket via FUSE, installing gsutil, dd (from coreutils), and iostat (from sysstat). Also, replace placeholders like "your-bucket" in the script before building.
Prerequisites

Install the Google Cloud CLI (gcloud) and authenticate with gcloud auth login.
Enable the required APIs: Run gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com.
Ensure you have the necessary IAM roles (e.g., Cloud Run Admin, Editor) for your account.
Upload test files (small_testfile ~1MB, large_testfile ~100MB) to your GCS bucket using gsutil cp.
Grant the Cloud Run service account access to your GCS bucket (e.g., via IAM: Storage Object Viewer/Creator roles).

## Step 1: Create the Dockerfile
Create a file named Dockerfile in a new directory with the following content. This uses an Ubuntu base for easy package installation, installs dependencies, mounts the GCS bucket using gcsfuse, and runs the script.

Replace your-bucket with your actual GCS bucket name in the ENTRYPOINT.
Adjust mount options (e.g., add --file-cache-max-size-mb=1024) as needed for your FUSE setup.
The ENTRYPOINT mounts the bucket at runtime and then runs the script.

## Step 2: Build and Push the Container Image

Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/latency-job:latest .

Replace [PROJECT-ID] with your Google Cloud project ID (find it with gcloud config get-value project).
```

Authenticate Docker with Artifact Registry (or use Container Registry):
textgcloud auth configure-docker

Push the image:
```bash
docker push gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/latency-job:latest
```

## Step 3: Deploy the Cloud Run Job
Deploy the job using gcloud:
```bash
gcloud run jobs create latency-measure-job \
    --image gcr.io/[PROJECT-ID]/latency-job:latest \
    --tasks 1 \
    --max-retries 3 \
    --task-timeout 600s \
    --region us-central1  # Choose your region
```
Adjust --tasks if you want parallel executions (but for this script, 1 is sufficient).
Use --execute-now to run immediately: Add it to the command above.
Optionally, set environment variables with --set-env-vars KEY=VALUE if needed (e.g., for dynamic bucket names).

## Step 4: Execute and Monitor the Job

Execute the job:
```bash
gcloud run jobs execute latency-measure-job --region us-central1
```

Monitor status and logs:
```bash
gcloud run jobs describe latency-measure-job --region us-central1
```
Or view logs in the Google Cloud Console under Cloud Run > Jobs > latency-measure-job > Logs.
The script's output (including time results and iostat) will appear in the logs. Review the "real" times for latency measurements.
